## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Download the Files**
   - Place the `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and any associated `images` into the same project folder. Make sure the CSS is in a `css` subfolder as referenced in the HTML.

2. **Open in Browser**
   - Simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). No web server is needed as it is a static site.
